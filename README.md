mathm is a very flexible calculator meant to run from terminal or fltk gui. I am mainly building it for when solving crackmes.

Planned features
- Basic math expected of all calculators with PEMDAS.
- More advanced math like algebra
- Output in hex and binary
- String to bytes and bytes to string.
- x64 assembly to bytes and bytes to x64 assembly.
